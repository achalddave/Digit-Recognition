# Digit recognizer

### Download the data
Just running `make` should download the data and put it in a "data/" directory

### Running the script
For now, running `python show.py [train|test]` will go through the training
(default) or test datasets, showing you the images and their labels. It's 
mostly just a way to view the format and see what's going on.

### Other files
I ideally want to test the following classifiers/attempts with this set:

* Naive Bayes
* Perceptrons (regular updates)
* SVMs
* Neural nets
* Gaussian classifiers
* Whatever else pops up

### Contributing
Whatever you do, just please don't add any AI libraries.
